  description: `
  Mangala, the God of Mars, has stopped the flow of seasons on Earth after
  kidnapping Mother Nature. He threatens to take over the Earth in her
  absence and turn it into a wasteland like Mars. Only Anemoi, the son of
  Mother Nature, has the ability to bring the seasons back and save the
  world. As the player, take control of Anemoi and use his minor control
  of the Seasons to stop Mangala and his goons and restore the seasonal
  cycle to Earth.
